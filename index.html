				David Wright is one of the most prominant and recognizable Mets players of all time. Wright spend his entire career with the Mets, becoming a legend of orange and blue. He has countless team records, including the most hits by a Mets player, the most total bases achieved by a Mets player, and the most runs batted in by any Mets player ever. Wright helped lead the Mets to the playoffs in 2006, and also was a key factor in getting the Mets to the World Series in 2015. The end of his career was plagued by injuries, most prominantly with his diagnosis of spinal stenosis, which sidelined him for over 2 years and eventually led to the end of his career in 2018.
